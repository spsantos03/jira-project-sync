  I need 2 slash commands that:                                                                                                                                                         
  First one (new projects):                                                                                                                                                             
  - initiates a git repository                                                                                                                                                          
  - creates .claude/jira-sync.json in the project root                                                                                                                                  
  - prompts me to create the Jira space                                                                                                                                                 
  - runs all this                                                                                                                                                                       
  - creates the project's CLAUDE.md with this info as well as the relevant project info                                                                                                 
  Second one (for onboarding existing projects):                                                                                                                                        
  - creates .claude/jira-sync.json in the project root                                                                                                                                  
  - prompts me to create the Jira space                                                                                                                                                 
  - imports all the existing commits into Jira, grouping them by subject into cards, keeping the commit date and all the commit info, and mark them as done                             
  - appends this info to the project's CLAUDE.md                                                                                                                                        
  - prepares the project with the Jira integration hook                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Suggest the name for the slash commands                                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  I also need to document this whole setup on the global CLAUDE.md file                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
  Should this be a plugin? If so, suggest a name for it also.
